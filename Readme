FILES INCLUDED AND USAGE

Dat.h 		:- GENERATE DATA AND RANDOMIZE TRAINING SET ( MNIST dataset ).
	The functions are wrapped in a class called Data.
	Essential Functions:
	Randomize : It randomizes the dataset for next epoch.
	getData   : It reads data from the binary files according to the format of MNIST .

	The images given are in gray scale. It is converted to binary by thresholding at 128.

NN.h		:- CONTAIN NN LIBRARY ( BACKPROPAGATION ).
	The functions are wrapped in a class called NeuralNet.
	Essential Functions:
	init 	:  It reads the weights that have been saved from previous training in the log file.
	NeuralNet :  The backpropagation algorithm is written inside this constructor.The parameters are Number of node in input layer , Number 		   of node in hidden layer , Number of node in output layer , learning rate ( preferably < 0.01 ) and momentum.

Just calling NeuralNet as in GNN.cpp with all the parameters will train the neural net and save the weights in log file.
